Excited to Share My Latest AWS Mini Project: Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3!

After diving into AWS, I decided to take on a mini project to solidify my understanding of cloud services. Here's a step-by-step guide on how I hosted a static website using an Amazon S3 bucket.

Project Overview:

Hosting a static website on S3 is a cost-effective and efficient way to showcase your portfolio, blog, or any other static content.

Steps to Get Started:

1. Create an S3 Bucket:

➡ Log in to the AWS Management Console.

➡ Navigate to S3 and click on "Create Bucket."

➡Choose a unique name (e.g., my-static-website) and select a region.

2. Configure Bucket for Static Website Hosting:

➡Click on your newly created bucket.

➡Go to the "Properties" tab and enable "Static website hosting."

➡ Specify the index document (e.g., index.html) and error document (e.g., error.html).

3. Upload Your Website Files:

➡ Go to the "Objects" tab and click on "Upload."

➡ Drag and drop your HTML, CSS, JS files, and images.

4. Access Your Website:

➡ After configuring everything, you'll find the endpoint URL in the "Static website hosting" section.

➡Open it in your browser to see your static site live!
